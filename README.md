# River raid

Navigate the air while trying to avoid a collision:

- with a river possibly changing in size

- with any human-made structure

- with rare, but solid islets

- with sky zig-zagging fliers

- with sea-faring floaters

Fire bullets to clear the way, as long as you can.

Pick up a tank cause you definitely need to refuel.

## Controls

- arrow keys to move left and right

- `space` key to progress and shoot
